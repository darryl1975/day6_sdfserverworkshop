I don't want to talk about anything.
Not in a mood. Please go away.
Be silent. Don't talk.
I don't understand what you are saying.
I reserve my rights not to talk about anything.
Do whatever you want to do, just don't get caught!
Please do what I tell you to do!
Do you actually understand what I am trying to tell you?
How many times do you need me to repeat to you?
